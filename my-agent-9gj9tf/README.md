# GitHub Copilot SDK — Invocations Protocol (Streaming)

A minimal getting-started agent using the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://pypi.org/project/github-copilot-sdk/) (`CopilotClient`) with the [azure-ai-agentserver-invocations](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-invocations/) protocol. Streams raw Copilot SDK session events as SSE with multi-turn support.

## How It Works

1. Receives `{"input": "..."}` via `POST /invocations`
2. On first request, tries to resume a persisted Copilot session (by `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID`); if none exists, creates a new one
3. Each `SessionEvent` from the Copilot SDK is streamed back as an SSE `data:` event using `event.to_dict()`
4. A final `event: done` signal marks the end of the response
5. The session is cached in memory and reused across requests for multi-turn conversation
6. Skills in the `skills/` directory are auto-loaded — e.g. the included `joke` skill makes Copilot respond in pirate tone

## Environment Variables

This agent supports two LLM backends. Configure one of the following:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For Copilot model | GitHub fine-grained PAT with **Copilot Requests → Read-only** permission |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | For Foundry model | Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL. Auto-injected when hosted — only needed locally |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | For Foundry model | Model deployment name (e.g. `gpt-4o`) |
| `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID` | No | Session ID for persistence/resume. If unset, a UUID is generated |

**How the agent selects its LLM backend:**
- If `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` are set → uses your **Foundry model** via Managed Identity (no `GITHUB_TOKEN` needed)
- If only `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set → uses the **GitHub Copilot model** (quickest way to get started)
- If both are set → the **Foundry model takes precedence**

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A GitHub fine-grained PAT (`github_pat_` prefix)

Create one at [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with **Account permissions → Copilot Requests → Read-only**.

> **Note:** Classic tokens (`ghp_`) are not supported. Use a fine-grained PAT (`github_pat_`), OAuth token (`gho_`), or GitHub App user token (`ghu_`).

### Using `azd` (Recommended)

Create a local `.env` file from the sample template and set `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # skip if .env already exists
# Edit .env and set GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
```

The sample loads `.env` automatically when running locally. If you plan to deploy with `azd`, also add the token to your azd environment so it can be injected into the hosted agent:

```bash
azd env set GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_..."
```

Next, start the agent locally with the `run` command:

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Using the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension

The [Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=vscode) has a built-in sample gallery. You can open this sample directly from the extension without cloning the repository, it scaffolds the project into a new workspace, generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically, and configures a one-click **F5** debug experience.

Chat with a running agent using the **Agent Inspector**:

1. Start the agent locally first using **Using `azd`** or **Without `azd`** above. The agent listens on `http://localhost:8088/`.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
3. The Inspector auto-connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat with the agent and watch the streamed responses.

### Without `azd`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # skip if .env already exists
# Edit .env and set GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
python main.py
```

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`.

## Invoke with azd

### Local

**Bash:**
```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local '{"input": "What can you help me with?"}'
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
azd ai agent invoke --local '{\"input\": \"What can you help me with?\"}'
```

### Test with curl

```bash
# First message
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8088/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "What is Python?"}'

# Follow-up (multi-turn — same session remembers context)
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8088/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Give me a code example"}'
```

### SSE Event Format

Each Copilot SDK event is streamed via `event.to_dict()`:

```
data: {"type": "assistant.message_delta", "data": {"delta_content": "Python is"}}\n\n
data: {"type": "assistant.message_delta", "data": {"delta_content": " a programming"}}\n\n
...
event: done
data: {"invocation_id": "...", "session_id": "..."}
```

## Using Your Own Foundry Model

To use your own Azure AI Foundry model instead of the Copilot model, set the Foundry variables (no `GITHUB_TOKEN` needed):

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project> \
AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o \
python main.py
```

Authentication uses Managed Identity via `DefaultAzureCredential`. When deployed as a hosted agent, `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is auto-injected by the platform — you only need to set `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in `agent.yaml`.

## Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

Once you've tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
# Provision Azure resources (skip if already done during local setup)
azd provision

# Build, push, and deploy the agent to Foundry
azd deploy
```

After deploying, invoke the agent running in Foundry:

**Bash:**
```bash
azd ai agent invoke '{"input": "What can you help me with?"}'
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
azd ai agent invoke '{\"input\": \"What can you help me with?\"}'
```

To stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Azure AI Foundry hosted agents](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs).

### Deploying with the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a tab-based **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate what it can.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one) to deploy to.
3. On the **Basics** tab, configure the core deployment settings:
   - **Deployment Method**: **Code** (upload as a ZIP) or **Container** (Docker image via ACR).
   - For **Code**, pick a packaging option: **Remote** or **Local**.
   - For **Container**, pick a registry option: default ACR, your own ACR, or a prebuilt ACR image.
   - **Hosted Agent Name**: confirm the name to register with the hosting service.
4. On the **Review + Deploy** tab, finalize the runtime and resources:
   - Confirm the auto-detected runtime details (language, entry point, or Dockerfile).
   - Pick a **CPU and Memory** size.
   - Click **Deploy**. Fields are validated inline, and the extension handles the build/upload, agent version creation, and RBAC role assignment.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Adding Skills

Any subdirectory under `skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` file is automatically loaded by the Copilot SDK. The included `joke` skill demonstrates this:

```
skills/
└── joke/
    └── SKILL.md    ← tells Copilot to respond like a pirate
```

To add your own skill, create a new folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`:

```bash
mkdir skills/my-skill
cat > skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for Copilot when this skill is active.
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend deploying with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
